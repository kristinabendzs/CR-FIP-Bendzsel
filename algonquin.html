                <p>Algonquin Park, the first provincial park in Ontario, 
                protected from the noise and rush of civilization, this world-renowned 
                park in ON is a sanctuary for the rugged beauty of the maple, pine, 
                moose, and wolves. A Provincial Park since 1893, the 7500 square kilometers
                 (3500 square miles) of Algonquin Park are home to a diverse and unblemished 
                 eco-system that can be found nowhere else on earth.</p>

                <p>Glaciers that receeded ten thousand years ago created the distinctive rock outcroppings and spring-fed lakes of Algonquin. These mountains of ice have left the park with a rough, stark beauty. This, combined with its location, 3 hours northeast of Toronto and 2 1/2 hours west of Ottawa makes Algonquin an ideal attraction for those looking to escape the hustle of the city.</p>

            <p>Algonquin park just steps away from The Couples Resort, Algonquin’s 7,630 square kilometres of forests, lakes, and rivers have assumed an almost incalculable importance as a living link with a vanishing past.</p>
